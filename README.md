# eCommerce Website - Canned Food Emporium

## The Goal
This repository is for an ongoing project currently being worked on for my college program. It is fully being worked on in the Community version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) using [Source Control](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/using-source-control-in-your-codespace) via [GitHub](https://github.com/). The goal of this project is to implement [CRUD Functionality](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/crud?view=aspnetcore-8.0) for entities using resources such as [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/?view=aspnetcore-8.0).

## The Progress
Currently, I am in the process of implementing basic [CRUD Functionality](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/crud?view=aspnetcore-8.0) to my website, along with updates to styling via [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/).

## Prerequisites
